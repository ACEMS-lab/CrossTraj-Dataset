CrossTraj is a high-resolution urban trajectory dataset collected at a midblock crosswalk in the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It captures detailed interactions between vehicles and pedestrians under both winter and summer conditions using panoramic roadside cameras. The dataset is designed for benchmarking detection, tracking, and behavior modeling algorithms in real-world urban traffic.
