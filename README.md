# CrossTraj Trajectory Dataset

**CrossTraj** is a high-resolution urban trajectory dataset collected at a midblock crosswalk in the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It captures fine-grained interactions between vehicles and pedestrians under diverse seasonal conditions, including both winter and summer.

This dataset is designed to support benchmarking in computer vision and behavior modeling tasks such as:

- Object detection
- Multi-object tracking
- Trajectory prediction
- Pedestrian-vehicle interaction analysis
